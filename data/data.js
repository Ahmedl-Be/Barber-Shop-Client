Even if I lived in a different borough, I would still come down here. This is how dedicated I am. If you find a decent barber, you stick with him or her. It takes some practise for them to get your hair precisely how you want it. Remain loyal to your barber."},
    {rating: 4,customer: "Daniel H", text: "I chanced upon this barbershop while walking by and was immediately drawn in by the beautiful plants in the window. I decided to give them a try, and I'm glad I did. The hospitality and service were excellent, and the covid sanitation standards were well up to par. It was great conversing with the staff, and overall it was a really pleasant experience. I'm glad to have found this hidden gem of a barbershop"},
    {rating: 5,customer: "Jesus G", text: "B&H Barbershop provided excellent service. It's clear that they are concerned about hygiene because the barbershop is spotless and well-kept, which is crucial during the pandemic. I trust this barber and tell all of my friends about him. But any of the barbers at B&H are a safe bet."},
    {rating: 5,customer: "Charles S", text: "Felt super welcomed as soon as I walked into this barbershop. I always feel so awkward at new barbershops, but I really felt comfortable here and the barber I went to really listened to what I wanted. For an introvert like me, there’s no reason to look for another shop. B&H is the one!"},
    {rating: 3,customer:"Jo G",text:"Sitting in the shop as I type this and I didn’t even get a haircut yet. I’m writing this for my friend who’s getting his haircut, and it looks fresh! That fade is super clean. Can’t wait to get my own haircut. I’m also celebrating local shops more often which is why im writing this review. Check out B&H barbershop!"},
    {rating: 5,customer:"Cole T",text:"I enjoy going here, the barbers here have all become friends, and I won't go anyplace else. East Village's top barbershop."}
